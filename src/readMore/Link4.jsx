            <div id="elementor-text-editor"><article>Have you ever heard the phrase,
            “<strong>’s not a diet, it’s a lifestyle”</strong>? This post is truly not
            about the diet you must follow or something you must follow for
            <strong>being healthy</strong>. Here I’ll speak about the concept of a
             <strong>“lifestyle”</strong> and the way we use this idea in
            many aspects of living our lives. <br /> One day I got an inspiration within
            the shower (<strong>things always come to you within the shower, haina?
            </strong>) that we attribute the word “lifestyle” to such a big amount
            of things we waste our everyday life. I feel 
            <strong>blogging </strong>is additionally a <strong>way of life</strong>,
             does one believe me? if yes, please continue reading. A blog is
            some things where bloggers speak about everything and anything from
            food to healthy living, from motivation to creativity, from enthusiasm to facts
            to lifestyle. I sometimes check with my blog as an enthusiastic
            lifestyle blog. </article><article>I would like to form my blog a community
            service where I can help people to inspire one another, can relate in
            a very way with one another, get a perspective about oneself. Other
            examples include living a school lifestyle, a graduate lifestyle, a
            minimalist lifestyle, etc. you’ll be a business owner, an intern, a
            painter, an artist, a creative, a traveler, a runner, an athlete, or an extreme
            adventurer.<br />Personally, over the past couple of years, I’ve experimented with
            living with a <strong>minimalist lifestyle</strong>, an artist lifestyle
            (which I like and wholeheartedly believe in).<br />A person can play the
            role of many identities at one time, in a very 
            single moment.</article><article>Perhaps there comes some extent where we start
            living too many lifestyles at one single point in our lives and that
            we skip to understand it.<br />But can too many “lifestyles”
            <strong>harm us</strong>, can <strong>mismatch</strong> our <strong>motive
            </strong>?<br />I question this as I realize the term “lifestyle” is
            growing so popular.<br />Does there come to a degree where we
            start living too many lifestyles at one time? Can we, ourselves
            can attach too many things to our identity that don’t even touch
            on us? That doesn’t really define who we actually are?<br />Have you
            heard that famous line from Harry Potter? “It’s our choices, that show
            what we truly are, much more than our abilities.”</article><article><br />I
            think lifestyle may be a journey on its own, as we move forward
            or age our lifestyles changes. I change in every heartbeat.<br />
            In today’s age, marketing and communications can create “lifestyles” out
            of nearly anything. In fact, that seems to be a goal of promoting a
            product – connecting it to something beyond the tangible item itself. as
            an example, marketing and exotic edible fruit juice as a
            significant ingredient to living a <strong>nomadic</strong>, <strong>
                super adventurous travel writer’s life</strong> connects items to a
            lifestyle certain people might want to measure. This
            <strong>creates stories,</strong> <strong>values, and feelings 
            </strong>that individuals can venture out and “buy.”
            <br />It’s almost as if we have a closet stuffed
            with “lifestyles” we will choose between every
            day. we are able to like better to be anything we
            would like to be.<br />In many cases, which will be a
            decent thing. I’m all about leaving options open! But what
            exactly may be a lifestyle and the way exactly are
            we choosing to live?</article><article><br />At last,<strong> I’d wish
            to say only 1 thing, read it carefully and realize
            it.</strong><br />Your life is filled with your good and bad
            choices, right?<br />So, whenever you select a lifestyle 
            choose it wisely. Choose the lifestyle on which you don’t
            regret after it creates a full lot of mess.<br />Sometimes I
            feel if I could return to my teens and alter a few of my
            lifestyles, but you recognize that can’t happen.<br />Always choose the
            lifestyle which you’re feeling is true for you and for your
            future!<br />It’s within the moment where we live vibrantly, <strong>let’s
            find our styles let’s shine through them</strong>.<br />Much love to all!</article></div>
